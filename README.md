# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Overview of Project
Working with AutoRUs on the production of their new prototype, MechaCar as there have been issues interfering with the manufacturer's team. Through statistical analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes as well as run statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots. From this analysis, we compare the manufacturing lots to discover if they are statistically different from the mean population followed by a comparison of vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Using the p-value, we analyzed how each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance. It was found that the vehicle length and ground clearance did provide non-random amount of variance to the mpg. The MPG is greatly affected by these factors.  

Considering that there was more than one factor that affected MPG, the slope of our linear model is not zero. We know this because the p-values are less than 0.05. With this information, we can reject the null hypothesis. 

After completion of the analysis, it was found that the linear model fit the current data provided. However, due to the variance seen in two factors, two of the dependent variables, the linear model may not be a good prediction of the MPG for the MechaCar in the future.
